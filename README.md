## About The Project

![gateapp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61760153/203745075-a281effa-88f5-4079-ae9b-a43ad16f1abd.png)


This project was created to help me while I was learning logic gates in school. Instead, it turned out to be a complex project with its own dragging and dropping system, 4 gates to choose from, fully functional LED element and a system to prevent user from moving elements outside of the main window. There is also a dumpster icon, where you can dispose of unused elements.


### Built With

Project is build entirely in typescript and has does not have any npm dependencies.

After You created basic setup consisting of at least to LEDs and one gate, You have to click on one of the gate's input areas.

Then You move your cursor to the LED diod and click again. It should connect these two elements and change diod's color to gate's one. To change LED's state, You have to basically click it (wihout clicking gate's input or output before). To actually see any changes You must connect gate's output to another LED, by going into selecting mode as You did before.
